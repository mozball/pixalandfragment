          <p>Today as the news from Selma and Saigon<br>
            poisons the air like fallout,<br>
            I come again to see<br>
            the serene, great picture that I love.<br><br>

            Here space and time exist in light<br>
            the eye like the eye of faith believes.<br>
            The seen, the known<br>
            dissolve in iridescence, become<br>
            illusive flesh of light<br>
            that was not, was, forever is.<br><br>

            O light beheld as through refracting tears.<br>
            Here is the aura of that world<br>
            each of us has lost.<br>
            Here is the shadow of its joy. </p>

          <p>What was the name you called me?—<br>
            And why did you go so soon?<br><br>

            The crows lift their caw on the wind,<br>
            And the wind changed and was lonely.<br><br>

            The warblers cry their sleepy-songs<br>
            Across the valley gloaming,<br><br>
            Across the cattle-horns of early stars.<br>

            Feathers and people in the crotch of a treetop<br>
            Throw an evening waterfall of sleepy-songs.<br><br>

            What was the name you called me?—<br>
            And why did you go so soon?</p>

          <p> The words are a beautiful music.<br>
            The words bounce like in water.<br><br>

            Water music,<br>
            loud in the clearing<br><br>

            off the boats,<br>
            birds, leaves.<br><br>

            They look for a place<br>
            to sit and eat--<br><br>

            no meaning,<br>
            no point.<br><br>

          <p> My whole life is mine, but whoever says so<br>
            will deprive me, for it is infinite.<br>
            The ripple of water, the shade of the sky<br>
            are mine; it is still the same, my life.<br><br>

            No desire opens me: I am full,<br>
            I never close myself with refusal-<br>
            in the rythm of my daily soul<br>
            I do not desire-I am moved;<br><br>

            by being moved I exert my empire,<br>
            making the dreams of night real:<br>
            into my body at the bottom of the water<br>
            I attract the beyonds of mirrors... </p>

          <p>The double moon, one on the high back drop of the west, one on the curve of the river face,<br><br>
            The sky moon of fire and the river moon of water, I am taking these home in a basket, hung on an elbow, such a teeny weeny elbow, in my head.<br><br>
            I saw them last night, a cradle moon, two horns of a moon, such an early hopeful moon, such a child’s moon for all young hearts to make a picture of.<br><br>
            The river—I remember this like a picture—the river was the upper twist of a written question mark.<br><br>
            I know now it takes many many years to write a river, a twist of water asking a question.<br><br>
            And white stars moved when the moon moved, and one red star kept burning, and the Big Dipper was almost overhead. </p>

          <p>A cool small evening shrunk to a dog bark and the clank of a bucket -<br>
            And you listening.<br>
            A spider's web, tense for the dew's touch.<br>
            A pail lifted, still and brimming - mirror<br>
            To tempt a first star to a tremor.<br><br>

            Cows are going home in the lane there, looping the hedges with their warm<br>
            wreaths of breath -<br>
            A dark river of blood, many boulders,<br>
            Balancing unspilled milk.<br>
            'Moon!' you cry suddenly, 'Moon! Moon!'<br><br>

            The moon has stepped back like an artist gazing amazed at a work<br>
            That points at him amazed.</p>

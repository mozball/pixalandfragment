          <p>Whosever room this is should be ashamed!<br>
            His underwear is hanging on the lamp.<br>
            His raincoat is there in the overstuffed chair,<br>
            And the chair is becoming quite mucky and damp.<br>
            His workbook is wedged in the window,<br>
            His sweater's been thrown on the floor.<br>
            His scarf and one ski are beneath the TV,<br>
            And his pants have been carelessly hung on the door.<br>
            His books are all jammed in the closet,<br>
            His vest has been left in the hall.<br>
            A lizard named Ed is asleep in his bed,<br>
            And his smelly old sock has been stuck to the wall.<br>
            Whosever room this is should be ashamed!<br>
            Donald or Robert or Willie or--<br>
            Huh? You say it's mine? Oh, dear,<br>
            I knew it looked familiar!</p>
